# grub-rescue
Utility to add a bootable ISO file to grub as rescue

Made to provide an easy way to restore the system using timeshift without burning another bootable medium

## Limitations
Grub supports booting ISO files for some time but it wont show any of the grub config

## TODO
- [ ] Write help how to use the script
- [ ] Test using UEFI system
- [ ] Copy actual menuentries from /boot/grub.cfg so you do not need to enter them manually
