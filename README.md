# Galena Linux
Experimental linux *distribution*[^1] based on debian stable, it makes a rock solid base system that discourages use of system packages including language-specific package manager but it does not actually stop you from doing so like immutable systems do

[^1]: Its more of a configuration script right now

## The Goal
With technologies like flatpak, snap, distrobox there are very little use cases where installing native packages is required, using these nowadays provides better tested but still up to date experience without plaguing the base system
So the system should be used similar to fedora silverblue but simpler, with more manual approach where user intentionally avoids system packages instead of forcing it upon them, but it does not have some of upsides of ostree approach
